# as1: Assignment 1 for CMPUT 301
Application that is a habit tracker/task tracker, letting a user add, complete, delete, and view histories of their habits/tasks!

Some Notes: <br/>
- a user will always see the current days view on start and can switch to all habits or history
- users will know that they completed the habit that day by either the green icon or the daily count
- users may delete an instance of a completion by deleting it in the history view 
- if a user completed a habit that is not on the previous day, they may undo it by deleting the completion

Enjoy!
